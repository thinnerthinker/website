<h2>Sursface - A cross-platform rendering library

</h2>

<h3>What?</h3>
A library that abstracts away all platform-specific details of window creation/management, hooking up the window to
WebGPU, inserting the canvas, etc.
What remains is a clean and C-friendly API that transparently grants access to wgpu's and winit's crates, and provides
resource management for your in-flight wgpu pipelines.
Besides runtime, compile-time processes are also pinned down exactly with the help of Nix. The flake created for the
project guarantees exact reproducibility, so everyone
can build it, from anywhere to anywhere else.
With all that friction automated out, Sursface is <i>the</i> way towards powerful graphics application on top of Rust.

<h3>Why?</h3>
Graphics applications are hard. Always has been this way, and is the same way in Rust. While wgpu and winit provide
wonderful abstractions towards this end
(and these are state of the art btw), tying them together in just the right way, amongst ever-changing APIs, is not
easy. So I waltzed in. In fact, I'd like to create
a <i>lot</i> of applications on top of this, so it is worth it for me to maintain and develop this further.
TLDR: selfishness

<h3>How?</h3>
Under the hood, Sursface uses wgpu for graphics (falling back to WebGL on WASM to prevent crashes from questionable
WebGPU support in browsers), and winit for window creation.
It also uses env_logger and fern, on desktop and browser respectively, to provide logging.
Right now all it does is create a clear window, but we are planning on giving the user full control over wgpu in this
window's context, and also provide user input data
and much more through winit.
At the bottom of it all, we have a Nix flake that uses Tomers, a homegrown Nix flake, that itself uses Fenix to create
the right Rust toolchain for each cross-platform target,
and Crane to do the Cargo build itself. Tomers wraps this all up in a nice giftbox and hands it to you in exchange for a
detailed description of platforms you want to target 
(you can spice this up with custom config too, like what other flags or post-install bash scripts you want to run, or
which files besides the executable you want to keep from the source).

Check out the GitHub, and the Examples on this site for embedded canvases running WASM compiled from my Linux laptop, or
rather, from the GitHub Actions VMs, for
which I wrote the flake to build on my Linux machine.

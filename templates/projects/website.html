This is an <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum">Axum</a> web server rendering
<a href="https://github.com/djc/askama">Askama</a> templates that I pieced together to create the pages.
I seldom use Javascript, only for hiding the WASM canvases by default as it is not polite to spontaneously blow up someone's phone with a single page load.
Also using JS for calling the bindings on the WASM examples. But the navbar states and all the rest are all static.

It is running at home, from my laptop, channeled through a Cloudflare tunnel to y'all. Hope you like it ;)
